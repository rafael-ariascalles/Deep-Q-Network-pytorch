# Deep-Q-Network-pytorch

Pytorch Implementation of Deep Q network Algorithm to solve Banana Navigation Problem (Unity Enviroment).


### Enviroment

In this it will be train an agent to collect Yellow Bananas in a large Square world. 
A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. 
Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. 
Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. 

Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

- 0 - move forward.
- 1 - move backward.
- 2 - turn left.
- 3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).
	
3. Clone the repository, and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies. or if you just need to prepare the enviroment just use the dependencies of the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```


in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/README.md) are more stepÂ´s on how to configure all the enviroments but unti here is possible to train the Agent

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
2. Place the file in this repository and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Instructions

Follow the steps in `Navigation.ipynb`  or run the `trainer.py` for the agent training.

run the command 
```bash
python trainer.py
```
